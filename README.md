# Practice01 - Java Basics
This is a beginner-level Java project to practice and master the fundamentals of Java, including:
- Variables and Data Types (`int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`)
- Arithmetic Operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Increment (`++`) and Decrement (`--`) Operators
- Boolean Comparisons and Relational Operators
- Explicit Type Casting
- Introduction to Arrays and `Arrays.toString()`

## 🚀 **What This Program Does**
- Declares and initializes primitive data types.
- Performs various arithmetic operations.
- Demonstrates increment and decrement operators.
- Compares variables using relational operators.
- Shows explicit type casting from `double` to `int`.
- Introduces arrays and prints them using `Arrays.toString()`.

## 🔧 **How to Compile and Run**  
Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd path/to/Practice01
```

Compile the Java file:
```bash
javac Practice01.java
```

Run the compiled class:
```bash
java Practice01
```

## 📊 **Output Example**  
```
Those are all the results for the challenge: 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0
Results from resultsArray: [2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0]
Those are the variables or the primitive data types you wanted me to print: 1, 2.0, C, true
This is the explicit casting, where you force it to happen: 2
```
